This project is a modern web application designed to help users easily discover and book lessons with language teachers from around the world. The platform offers a smooth, user-friendly experience that allows learners to browse a large catalog of professional instructors, compare their qualifications, check their availability, and schedule lessons in just a few clicks.

The application provides a structured presentation of each teacher, including their personal information, teaching experience, languages they specialize in, and a detailed proficiency level that reflects their expertise. In addition to skill level, every teacher has an individual rating based on reviews and feedback from students who have taken lessons before. This enables learners to make informed decisions and choose the most suitable instructor for their needs, whether they are complete beginners or advanced speakers looking to refine their fluency.

A key goal of the platform is to simplify the process of connecting language learners with qualified instructors. Users can browse teachers by language, proficiency level, popularity, rating, or teaching style. The interface is built to be intuitive and responsive, ensuring accessibility across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. With a seamless registration and login flow, users can quickly create an account, mark favorite teachers, manage their personal preferences, and keep track of upcoming lessons.

From a technical standpoint, the project uses a modular and scalable architecture. React, Zustand, React Router, and various modern tools are utilized to maintain global application state, manage routes, and ensure a smooth user experience. The design is fully theme-supported, allowing users to personalize the visual appearance of the website with multiple color themes, all powered by CSS variables and dynamic updates.

Overall, this project aims to deliver a reliable and enjoyable platform for anyone seeking to learn a new language or improve existing skills through personalized, high-quality instruction from real teachers.
